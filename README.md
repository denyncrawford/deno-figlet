**Deno-Figlet** is a JavaScript/Typescript implementation of a FIGfont driver builded and available for Deno ðŸ¦• (Soon browser availability).

[Figlet](http://www.figlet.org/) is a program for making large letters out of ordinary text.

If you want to know more about how a Figlet font is builded, please check out [the FIGfont documentation](http://www.jave.de/figlet/figfont.html).

> **Notice:** All the fonts in this package are not my property, all credits to their creators (if you want to know who created a font, you can look inside each font).

# :computer: Installation

## :inbox_tray: Importing 

```javascript
import filget from 'https:/deno.land/x/node-figlet.js'
```

## :wrench: Basic Usage:

**Deno-Figlet** exports by default the quick method wich runs without specifiying the font or ditctionary preset.

```javascript
let myAwesomeFiglet = await figlet("Deno is Awesome.")
console.log(myAwesomeFiglet)
```

**It should print**:
	
	 ____                            _                                                                     _ 
 	|  _ \    ___   _ __     ___    (_)  ___     __ _  __      __   ___   ___    ___    _ __ ___     ___  | |
 	| | | |  / _ \ | '_ \   / _ \   | | / __|   / _` | \ \ /\ / /  / _ \ / __|  / _ \  | '_ ` _ \   / _ \ | |
 	| |_| | |  __/ | | | | | (_) |  | | \__ \  | (_| |  \ V  V /  |  __/ \__ \ | (_) | | | | | | | |  __/ |_|
 	|____/   \___| |_| |_|  \___/   |_| |___/   \__,_|   \_/\_/    \___| |___/  \___/  |_| |_| |_|  \___| (_)


You can also import the methods text and textCB if you want to select the font and/or set a custom dictionary.

```javascript
import filget, { text, textCB } from 'https:/deno.land/x/deno-figlet.js'

let myAwesomeFiglet = await text("Deno is Awesome.","starwars")
console.log(myAwesomeFiglet)

```
You will get an awesome Star Wars figlet :wink: :rocket:.

For the ones who likes the NodeJS figlet API you can use textCB, wich gets the same results on first param into a callback function:

```javascript

textCB("Deno is Awesome.", "doom", null, (myAwesomeFiglet) => {
	console.log(myAwesomeFiglet)
})

```
You will get an awesome Star Wars figlet :heart: :gun:.
